      <p>One of the difficulties of working in an office like mine, is that you are stationed at your desk for the majority of the day.  Eight hours a day- five days a week- of this will eventually catch up to you.
      </P>
    <p>Chances are, you will:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Gain Weight</li>
      <li> Lose Muscle Mass and Strength</li>
      <li> Have Weaker Bones</li>
      <li> Lower Immune System</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p> Alternatively, an active lifestyle can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduce Stress</li>
      <li>Increase Energy</li>
      <li>Increase Motivation</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Of course, there are also many things that can make finding time to live an active life harder. Things such as, working two jobs, going to school and studying for a potential career change.  This read is for those that find it difficult to live such a life, but still find it important to try.</p>

      <p>Living an active lifestyle can not only have a positive impact on you physically, but also mentally.  There are two ways one can view living a healthy/active life.  It can be something that can bring you joy, long health, and happiness, or, something that you have to keep doing, something that will force you to eat bland food and something that will be too hard to do.  It is important that we identify our motivations, and if need be, reformat it so that we are motivated by positive, instead of negative.

Ideally, the best type of an “active lifestyle” is one where you don’t feel that you are doing it.  One where, for example, you bike to work instead of driving.  Another is where you can choose to have fast food, but a healthy version, rather than the usual greasy burgers and pizzas.  Having an office job in NYC, the environment will not be conducive for this to happen.  It will be hard for those that have to find time to be active.  Before setting out on this journey, be aware that you are entering a losing battle, where the only chance of winning is through determination, and relentlessness.

      Much more than activity, though important none the less, diet has the highest impact on health.  As I have mentioned before, the environment in NYC is not helpful when it comes to healthy eating.  Think for a second, how many fast food places do you know that are also healthy?  When you are tired, and hungry, where can you get a choice of healthy fast food?  Funny enough, it costs more for a salad at McDonalds, than a burger.  Sad as it may be, this is just how our society is set up to be.

After working for 8 hours, studying for 2 hours, and going to the gym for 1.5 hours, where should I eat?  Wendy’s… An order of a double bacon burger, grilled chicken, fries, water and a dessert will do me well.  The kicker here, is how I eat this meal.
Before I eat though, I remind myself of the plan; eat healthy and eat consciously.

First, I eat the grilled chicken burger.  Sometimes, I eat just the chicken.  As I am doing so, I am taking my time, sipping my water and consciously taking fries.  After the grilled chicken is finished, I drink some more water.  At this point, I would pause and observe what else is left.  Small French fries, a double bacon burger, and a dessert.  Having finished the grilled chicken, the water, and some of the fries (70% full) I move on to dessert.  At this point, I may already feel full and I would just need a bite or two of my dessert and I would be done.  What about the burger you say? Well, you can either save it or, if you are still hungry, just have a couple of bites until satisfied.  If you were eating consciously this whole time, you should be able to hold back on eating the second burger, and the rest of the fries and drink.

In essence, you would have just had 30% of the small fries, water, grilled chicken sandwich and some dessert; and maybe a couple bites of the double burger.

Compared to a Double bacon quarter pounder with cheese, small fries and a cola, our meal was healthier.  The next time you pull up to a fast food joint, order their healthiest option, (grilled chicken sandwich or salad) and eat consciously. 

It will not always be easy to eat healthy, but the key is the bounce right back and keep on trying.

    <p>Having an active lifestyle, on top of other obligations, is hard.  The key is to make time. The best activities to take part in are those that are fun to you.  These activities could be:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Biking</li>
      <li>Playing Basketball At The Park</li>
      <li>Swimming</li>
      <li>Exploring the neighborhood</li>
      <li>Going on walks</li>
      <li>Jogging outside</li>
      <li>Lifting Weights</li>
    </ul>
    <P>
      "Working Out Without Working Out"
      </p>
    <p>It will be difficult to find things to do everyday, but the key is to keep trying.

  <p>Weekends should be tracked as well.  Living a healthy/active life style is not restricted to only the weekdays.  It is easy to take a “day off” on the weekends but it is not advised.  Doing things everyday will give you a better/ more worth it result. </p>

  <p>This can be applied to every aspect of your life.  Whenever motivation is low, ask yourself these three questions:</p>
<ul>
  <ol>Can you do it?</ol>
  <ol>Will It Work?</ol>
  <ol>Is It Worth It?</ol>
</ul>
  
  <p>If you can answer all of these questions with a “Yes”, then what is stopping you from achieving the goal?</p>
  <p>Happy Living, Cheers!</p>
